## Whats WOLF-PACK-WATCHER ?

this script works periodically and watching infinitely a telegram channel,
when new configs are sent into the watching channel script get the config, parse it, and create the same configuration in your server,
when config is created in your server script send the config link in your telegram bot ( if you activate it in the setup level ) ( soon )


### GOALS

- we released this script to avoid pressure on one server (Single point of failure)
- when a professional guy sends a config ( they can use fake information to the server-related data ) to the channel, everyone can have that config on their servers
- in future releases, we could try to use ambiguous or customized words ( for example: wolf:// instead of vless:// ) and other things to make harder blocking configs
- it's can be good to use encryption in future versions
- the professionals don't need to explain the technical implementation of network issues, they can just send a config into their channels and everyone is connected :)




Good Luck,
